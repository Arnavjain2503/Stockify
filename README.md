## Code Overview

### Key Components
- **MainActivity.java**: Manages the main UI, user interactions, and displays fetched stock data.
- **SplashActivity.java**: Shows the splash screen with animation during app launch.
- **GraphView.java**: Custom view for rendering the graph animation on the splash screen.
- **StockViewModel.java**: Handles the business logic, fetching data from the Finnhub API via Retrofit.
- **StockApiService.java**: Defines API endpoints for fetching stock quotes and company profiles.
- **CompanyProfileResponse.java & StockQuoteResponse.java**: Data models for handling API responses.

### XML Files Overview
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Defines application permissions, components, and metadata.
- **activity_main.xml**: Layout for the main activity, including the search bar and stock data display.
- **activity_splash.xml**: Layout for the splash screen, showing branding or animations during launch.
- **graph_anim.xml**: Defines the custom view for rendering animated graphs on the splash screen.
- **bottom_nav_menu.xml**: Specifies the items and icons for the bottom navigation bar.

### API Integration
- The app integrates with the [Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/) to fetch real-time stock data, company profiles, and additional information.
- **Retrofit** is utilized for making efficient network requests with appropriate error handling.

### Permissions
The app requires the following permission in `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Retrofit 2 Dependencies
The App uses following Retrofit 2 dependencies in `build.gradle` (Module: app) file:
```groovy
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
```

### Technologies Used
- **Java** for Android development.
- **Retrofit** for API requests.
- **ViewModel** for maintaining a clean separation of UI and business logic.
- **Glide** for loading images (e.g., company logos).

### Finnhub API Endpoints
The app uses the Finnhub API for real-time stock data:
- **/quote**: Fetches current stock prices, percentage changes, opening price, high/low prices, and previous close.
- **/profile2**: Retrieves detailed company profile information, including company name, logo, and exchange information.

### Important Note
- The app primarily works with US stock markets. You can check stock prices at any time, but the every-minute update feature will only work during US market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST, 7:00 PM to 1:30 AM IST for Indian investors).

- If the network connection is slow, data fetching from the API will take longer, especially when using an Android Virtual Device (AVD). It's recommended to use AVD with a fast network connection. Alternatively, you can run the app on a physical device by connecting via cable or using the APK for smoother performance.
