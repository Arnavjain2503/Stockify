## Code Overview

### Key Components
- **MainActivity.java**: Manages the main UI, user interactions, and displays fetched stock data.
- **SplashActivity.java**: Shows the splash screen with animation during app launch.
- **GraphView.java**: Custom view for rendering the graph animation on the splash screen.
- **StockViewModel.java**: Handles the business logic, fetching data from the Finnhub API via Retrofit.

- **Retrofit** is utilized for making efficient network requests with appropriate error handling.

### Permissions
The app requires the following permission:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Retrofit 2 Dependencies
The App uses following Retrofit 2 dependencies in `build.gradle` (Module: app) file:
```groovy
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
```

### Technologies Used
- **Java** for Android development.
- **Retrofit** for API requests.
- **ViewModel** for maintaining a clean separation of UI and business logic.
- **Glide** for loading images (e.g., company logos).

### Important Note

If the network connection is slow, data fetching from the API will take longer, especially when using an Android Virtual Device (AVD). It's recommended to use AVD with a fast network connection. Alternatively, you can run the app on a physical device by connecting via cable or using the APK for smoother performance.
